    Also output the directed graph in a format that I can later plug into gephi or nice designs.
    gephi tutorial: https://gephi.org/tutorials/gephi-tutorial-quick_start.pdf

    NB: networkx's finds the shortest path in directed, weighted graphs using Dijkstra's algorithm, which interprets
        higher edge weights as "larger" distances (using a road-network analogy), so your centrality scores on
        are going to be inverted if you use normal weight. Consequently, for betweenness centrality I use reciprocal
        values for weights, so that Dijkstra optimises properly.

        https://brilliant.org/wiki/dijkstras-short-path-finder/

    NB: commnunity detection is tricky on directed graphs, so instead I make the digraph undirected, with edge
        weights equalling out-degree plus in-degree weights. So we still have a flow network, albeit undirected
        I could also use the InfoMap API but messing around with it gave me only one partition
