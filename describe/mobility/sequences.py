    Makes a table with twelve columns (zero-indexed):

        col 0  = person ID
        col 1 = entry year (first year in career)
        col 2 = gender
        col 3 = number of region changes in first 6 years on the job
        col 4 = number of region changes in first 11 years on the job
        col 5 = number of region changes in first 15 years on the job
        col 6 = time to tribunal promotion (if occurred)
        col 7 = time to court of appeals promotion (if occurred)
        col 8 = own cohort's average time to tribunal promotion OF THOSE PROMOTED
        col 9 = own cohort's average time to promotion OF THOSE PROMOTED
        col 10 = length of sequence (i.e. career length in years)
        col 11 = joint sequence of hierarchical position and geographic movement
        col 12 = first five years of said sequence (i.e. sequence truncated after five years; fifth year included)
        col 13 = first ten years of said sequence (i.e. sequence truncated after ten years; tenth year included)

    The hierarchical position code shows where in the judicial hierarchy the person is. The elements are:
        LC = municipal, low court, TB = county tribunal, CA = regional court of appeals, HC = national high court.

    The geographic movement code shows whether the person moved workplace and if they changed appellate court region,
    since last year. The elements are "NT" for "no move", "MW" for "moved within appellate region," and "MB" for
    "moved between appellate regions."

    By convention, moves are compared to last year, so e.g. TB-MB means "this year in tribunal, last year in low court,
    move took place between appellate regions.

    We then combine these two element sets (alphabet expansion) to create the final set of elements that we use to
    construct the sequences:

        LC-NM = low court, no move             LC-MW = low court, move within region
        TB-NM = tribunal, no move              TB-MW = tribunal, move within region
        CA-NM = court of appeals, no move      CA-MW = court of appeals, move within region
        HC-NM = high court, no move

        LC-MB = low court, move between regions
        TB-MB = tribunal, move between regions
        CA-MB = court of appeals, move between regions

        HC-M = high court, move (because there is only one court in the land)

    The resulting sequences will look like e.g. LC-NM|LC-NM|TB-MW|TB-NM|TB-NM|CA-MB|CA-NM, where each year is
    separated by the pipe "|".
