"""
This code crawls through the old page of the Romanian Superior Council of the Magistracy to download
files containing monthly lists of all judges and prosecutors employed in every court and prosecutor's
office (or "parquet") in Romania, for the period 2009-2017. The files are then saved in a zip archive with
(imaginary) structure year --> month --> largest territorial unit (e.g.. a court of appeals jurisdiction,
with all subordinate courts), to the current directory.
